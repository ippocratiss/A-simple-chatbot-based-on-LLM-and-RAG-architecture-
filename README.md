## Authors

## Code 
- The code provides a simple chatbot which can assist with information assistance, using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology combined with a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM). The code is also capable of summarising papers from the scientific repository arXiv. 

- This version of the code is a very pre-liminary version and has received extremely basic testing only. The current form of the code runs on a Jupyter notebook for illustrative convenience.

    
### Versions 
    python 3
    langchain  0.1.16
    torch  2.2.2
    huggingface-hub 0.22.2
